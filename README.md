# Parallel-Distributed-Algorithms


In this project, I parallelized in C language the function using pthread, 
an implementation of the thread API for C/C++. 
This technique is used to obtain a better complexity for program,
because we have to read and modify a large input from text files given.
The program scales successfully.
